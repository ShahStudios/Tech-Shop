# Tech-Shop
Tech-Shop Created Using Java. The application starts with a base class called products that is used to have general fields that relate to items sold on new egg(electronic online store). I use several getter and setters alongside my constructor to get the program started. There is inheritance used multiple items created, and even a factory class that is used as a singleton. Overall this application is used for practicing OOP concepts mainly and making them work all together in one application.

# What I Learned
* How to use polymorphism to redefine methods for derived classes
* How to use enum type to create a predefined list of values whcih represent textual data
* How to create a singleton class to provide global access to get the instance of the class
